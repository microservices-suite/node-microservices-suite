# Microservices Suite

## Handle cross-cutting concerns using this library folder (DRY lives here 😎)

All reusable code should live here. You can use `no-hoist` to symlink this files as packages close to your working directory by adding them to the root package.json or root of your workspace. 
```json
  "workspaces": {
    "nohoist": [
      "**/@microservices-suite/<foo>",   
    ]
  }
```

This means you do not need to rebuild your app in development as your changes are `synchronized` by yarn workspace tool.
When your libraries pass all tests simply `yarn publish | npm publish` to `@microservices-suite` private registry to easily install them in production 🔥
